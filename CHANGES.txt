V3.1.0
 Users:
   - New Angular distribution viewer (right click on any SetOfParticles or SetOfSubtomograms will list it)

   - function retry search for fatal error messages in the output and if found,  it aborts instead of trying several times.
   - plotter.py uses logging
   - Plotter.plotAngularDistribution refactored: uses scatter instead of plot fo each point. It may improve performance.

   - Use new Config.isScipionRunning to register file handlers.
   - Use new Config.isScipionRunning to print xmipp ghost message.
   - SetOfImages._samplingRateStr extracted to convert sampling rate to a str

developers:
   - New model class: SetOfPrincipalComponents(SetOfNormalModes)

   - Variable wizard with customizable target, input and output parameters


V3.0.15
users:
  - New viewer: ChimeraAttributeViewer: analyze scalar attributes of the residues or atoms in a structure

  - Adding the protocol "Manual check point" that kept running for a time determined by a parameter or until
    the user determines it is convenient.

     import masks
     import mics
     import movies
     movie alignments
     ctf estimators
     pickings
     extraction
  - Filebrowser preview for images limited to 500MB (default). MAX_PREVIEW_FILE_SIZE (in MB) can be used to change this value.

V3.0.13

  JAVA_MAX_MEMORY defaults to 4GB for a better user experience with large datasets
  Take CHIMERA_HOME from chimera plugin if available. Otherwise will go for chimerax-1.2.5 as default
  Clean problematic characters in filenames: ;<>?"()|*\'&
  "filter set" protocols extended to filter by coordinate distance.
  "edit set" protocol extended to allow editing angular information.
  .gain files are treated as tiff files when getting its dimensions.

  Transform class provides a "create" (factory method) to create common transformations.
  pwem.convert.headers.fixVolume: to fix mrc headers of volumes.

V3.0.12
users:
  fix create user subsets with classes2D

developers:
  pwem.convert.headers.fixVolume: fixes the header of a volume defined as stack, so we can avoid :mrc suffix in paths the paths.
  images imported by ProtImportImage and ProtImportMask remove problematic characters -> PROBLEMATIC_SHELL_CHARS = ;<>?"()|*\'&

  mrc, pdb, vol files can be open with Chimera from the file browser
  rec file can be imported (not yet displayed by xmipp)

  EmSet has a create copy method to properly copy a Set

  tilt series subsets bug fixed
  MaskVolumeWizard - Creates a mask for a volume interactively. Masks currently implemented: Spherical mask

users:
  "set filter" protocol and wizard
  protocol tree (left panel) collapsed at loading
developers:
  protocols.conf created taken from scipion-app defining its own protocols.
  Add getTransformMatrix function, finds transformation matrix between to PDB files

V3.0.16
users:
   - Fixing an error calculating the FSC resolution value. 
   - FSC plots legend shows "resolution" ;-)
   - Align movies protocols: possible outputs for even odd mics defined
   - Import volume: fix downloading some old EMD id not numeric
   - Hdf files can be open from the file browser
   - Adding the protocol "box size related parameters" to estimate the different parameters needed for various pickers.
      
developers:
   - New method at pwem/convert/headers.setMRCSamplingRate: sets the sampling rate of an mrc file. Image Object has it: volume.setMRCSamplingRate(3.5) should work.
   - protcols.conf minimized only containig its own protocols 


V3.0.15
users:
  - New viewer: ChimeraAttributeViewer: analyze scalar attributes of the residues or atoms in a structure
  - Local resolution viewers use now native ChimeraX key
  - Adding the protocol "Manual check point" that kept running for a time determined by a parameter or until
    the user determines it is convenient.
  - Calculating the FSC resolution value and displaying it in the viewer.
V3.0.14
users:
  - New protocol: numeric classes extractor: Extracts items from a SetOfClasses based on number of items assigned to the classes
  - Filter ser protocol can filter by ranking: ascending or descending getting N items or a percentage.
  - Outputs predefined for:
     import masks
     import mics
     import movies
     movie alignments
     ctf estimators
     pickings
     extraction
  - Filebrowser preview for images limited to 500MB (default). MAX_PREVIEW_FILE_SIZE (in MB) can be used to change this value.

V3.0.13
users:
  JAVA_MAX_MEMORY defaults to 4GB for a better user experience with large datasets
  Take CHIMERA_HOME from chimera plugin if available. Otherwise will go for chimerax-1.2.5 as default
  Clean problematic characters in filenames: ;<>?"()|*\'&
  "filter set" protocols extended to filter by coordinate distance.
  "edit set" protocol extended to allow editing angular information.
  .gain files are treated as tiff files when getting its dimensions.

developers:
  Transform class provides a "create" (factory method) to create common transformations.
  pwem.convert.headers.fixVolume: to fix mrc headers of volumes.

V3.0.12
users:
  fix create user subsets with classes2D

developers:
  pwem.convert.headers.fixVolume: fixes the header of a volume defined as stack, so we can avoid :mrc suffix in paths the paths.
  images imported by ProtImportImage and ProtImportMask remove problematic characters -> PROBLEMATIC_SHELL_CHARS = ;<>?"()|*\'&

V3.0.11
users:
  mrc, pdb, vol files can be open with Chimera from the file browser
  rec file can be imported (not yet displayed by xmipp)
  fix import of particles stack with one image

developers:
  EmSet has a create copy method to properly copy a Set
  useful for generic set handling (subset, join set, user subset)
  tilt series subsets bug fixed
  MaskVolumeWizard - Creates a mask for a volume interactively. Masks currently implemented: Spherical mask

V3.0.10
users:
  "set filter" protocol and wizard
  protocol tree (left panel) collapsed at loading
developers:
  protocols.conf created taken from scipion-app defining its own protocols.
  Add getTransformMatrix function, finds transformation matrix between to PDB files
  Add partial support for eer files, just reading dimensions (part 1)
